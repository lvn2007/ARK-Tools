# ARK-Tools

* ARK Tools is a simple bot/script that was produced when I was playing ARK: Survival Evolved competitively with my team, B & W on OC-PVP-Official-Ragnarok95
* It was initially formulated on Python environment then deployed on C# for useability & performance purposes. Given the nature of the demand of functionality was changing rapidly, this tool was leveraging Agile methodology as its main framework
* This tool will provide its user a tremendous amount of competitive advantage in multiple ways. Meanwhile it does NOT violate/break the game's TOS, un-detected nor breaking the game since it does not interfere with game's files/data (DLL Injection, memory hacking, etc.)
